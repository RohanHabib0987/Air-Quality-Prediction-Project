# Air-Quality-Prediction-Project
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (or Python script) that demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting air quality. The process covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, and the application of several classification algorithms with their evaluation metrics.
